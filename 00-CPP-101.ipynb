You must explicitely release these resources by calling appropriate functions (e.g., <tt>H5*close</tt>) that tell the library that the application does no longer require those resources. Failing to release unused resources (a resource leak) often leads to poor performance, abnormal program behavior, or application or system crashes, etc.\n",

    "C/C++ programs need to be compiled into machine code before they can be executed. Variables are typed and the most important HDF5 library C-API type is `hid_t` for identifying and tracking HDF5 entities. Values of type `hid_t` are signs which symbolize resources allocated by the HDF5 library on behalf of the caller. The caller is responsible for releasing resources no longer required (Powell rule). For application developers, several fine C++ language bindings of the HDF5 library are available. If you are already using the HDF5 library through __[`h5py`](https://www.h5py.org/)__, __[HDFql](https://www.hdfql.com/)__, or __[`rhdf5`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rhdf5.html)__, good for you! &#128077;"
