    "If you are used to managing data in a (No)SQL database, you will find HDFql very familiar. It is a high-level (declarative) language that allows you to manage HDF5 files using a SQL-like language and only a few lines of code in C, C++, Java, Python, Fortran, C#, or R. See the __[HDFql website](https://www.hdfql.com/)__ for more information. The HDFql implementation depends on the HDF5 library, but all of that is hidden from users. HDFql support threading and parallel I/O, but we will not cover that here. Check out the __[HDFql documentation](https://www.hdfql.com/#documentation/)__ for more information!\n",
    "\n",
    "The C++ version of our model problem is our starting point, but we will use the HDFql bindings instead of the HDF5 library C-API."

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation is pretty simple. You can download binaries from the __[HDFql website](https://www.hdfql.com/)__ for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Extract the zip file and add the `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable, and you are ready to go. Without writing any code, you can use the `HDFqlCLI` command-line tool to create, read, and write HDF5 files."

    "\n",
    "Instead of introducing a new language, we'll stick with C++. The sample path generation is the same as before, but we will use the HDFql C++ bindings to write the data to an HDF5 file. Our workhorse will be the `HDFql::execute` function, which takes a string as an argument and executes it as an HDFql statement. The HDFql statements are very similar to SQL statements, but they are not identical. The HDFql website has a __[quick start](https://www.hdfql.com/quickstart)__ where you can look up the syntax.\n",

    "2. `DATASET` is a reserved keyword in HDFql, so we must escape it by using quotation marks. (See lines 33 for an example.)\n",
    "3. We show how to register the array variable `ou_process` with HDFql so that we can use it in the HDFql `CREATE DATASET` statement. (See line 33 for an example.)"
