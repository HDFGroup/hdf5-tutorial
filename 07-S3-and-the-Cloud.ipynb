    "In the previous notebook, we showed how the library can use a VOL connector to access files stored in a cloud backend through HSDS. But this is not the only way to use HDF5 in the cloud. HDF5 files stored in an S3 bucket can be accessed directly from the library without any external connector or drivers. This is possible through the Read-Only S3 VFD (ROS3 VFD). \n",

    "## Cloud-Optimized\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible to read HDF5 files in their native format directly from the Cloud, this introduces some inefficiencies. The access patterns of the library were optimized for filesystem I/O, not cloud access and the delays it brings. These concerns motivated the development of the [HDF5 Cloud-Optimized Read-Only Library (H5Coro)](https://github.com/ICESat2-SlideRule/h5coro). H5Coro a pure Python implementation of a subset of the HDF5 specification that has been optimized for reading data out of S3. For large files, H5Coro can speed up access times by [two orders of magnitude](https://www.hdfgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/JPSwinski_H5Coro.pdf). This is achieved primarily through using a larger cache to avoid repeated small reads to the cloud."
