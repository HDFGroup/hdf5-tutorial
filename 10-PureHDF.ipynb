    "__[PureHDF](https://github.com/Apollo3zehn/PureHDF)__ is a .NET library implemented in C# for reading and writing HDF5 files. It is a pure .NET implementation of the HDF5 file format, and does not rely on any native libraries.  In other words, it is an independent (of the HDF5 library) implementation of an API and the HDF5 file format specification. It is based on the __[HDF5 File Format Specification Version 3.0 ](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/develop/_f_m_t3.html)__.\n",

If you thought that .NET was a Windows-only Microsoft thing, then this is your chance to experience a modern, free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications, and HDF5 is a first-class citizen."
